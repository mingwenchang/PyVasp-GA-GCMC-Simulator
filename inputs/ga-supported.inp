#Data setting
#NOTE:
#For a supported cluster ga mode
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined BARE/CLEAN surface. 
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species with the following orders:
#slab-atom1, slab-atom2,..., clu-atom1, clu-atom2,... (Always put POTCARs of slab atoms in the first!!)
inputs: # the '-' symbole is required. 
   - INCAR
   - KPOINTS 
   - POTCAR 
   - POSCAR 
#  - vdw_kernel.bindat #for vdw-DFT calculations

#environment setting:
vacuum: True #GA simulation in the NVT ensemble 
temperature: 300. #(K) Boltzmann population at a given temperature  
 
#GA run setting:
#This setting will generate and screen over 40*12 = 480 structures 
gamode: supported #free/supported
maxgacycle: 40 # maximum itetative cycle for GA 
genpopsize: 12 #the population size for GA per generation
mutationrate: 0.80 # 0 < mutation rate < 1
 
#Cluster composition setting:
#formate (the order is matter!!):   
cluster: #same as your POTCAR!! 
    - Au: 8
#   - Pd: 2
#   - atom: natoms 

#Supported cluster landing setting:
landingat: [0.500, 0.500, 0.2377] #fractional coordinate!; bracket is required
altitude: 2.30 #The dz distance between the cluster and the slab
nanchors: 4 #how many bonds between the cluster and the slab (~ natoms/2)

#HPC setting
hpc: cartesius #cartesius/tue/(a path to a yaml file) 
ncpus: 96 #the number of processors (cpus) per a job 
walltime: 4 #the time limit (hours) for a job 
refreshtime: 300 #refresh time (sec) for the info update of GA 
maxretry: 2  #max. attempts for an unconverged job

#Converge criterion setting
force: 0.05  #force unit in Angstrom/eV (same as the ediffg value in INCAR)

#The parameters to characterize two clusters whether identical:
#Usually, you don't neet to change them.
#cf. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4886337
drel: 0.03 #the relative accumulated differences between two candidates
dmax: 0.07 #the maximum difference between two distances in two candidates 
dene: 0.02 ##the minimum energy difference between two candidates
