#Data setting
#NOTE:
#For a free cluster ga mode:
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined box
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species in the cluster 
inputs: # the '-' symbole is required. 
   - INCAR
   - KPOINTS 
   - POTCAR 
   - POSCAR 
#  - vdw_kernel.bindat #for vdw-DFT calculations

#environment setting:
vacuum: True #GA simulation in the NVT ensemble 
temperature: 300. #(K) Boltzmann population at a given temperature  

#GA run setting:
#This setting will generate and screen over 30*12 = 360 structures 
gamode: free #free/supported
maxgacycle: 30 # maximum itetative cycle for GA 
genpopsize: 12 #the population size for GA per generation
mutationrate: 0.80 # 0 < mutation rate < 1

#Cluster composition setting:
#formate (the order is matter!!):   
cluster: #same as your POTCAR!! 
    - Au: 8
#   - Pd: 2
#   - atom: natoms 

#HPC setting
hpc: cartesius #cartesius/tue/(a path to a yaml file) 
ncpus: 24 #the number of processors (cpus) per a job 
walltime: 4 #the time limit (hours) for a job 
refreshtime: 300 #refresh time (sec) for the info update of GA 
maxretry: 2  #max. attempts for an unconverged job

#Converge criterion setting
force: 0.05  #force unit in Angstrom/eV (same as the ediffg value in INCAR)

#The parameters to characterize two clusters whether identical:
#Usually, you don't neet to change them.
#cf. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4886337
drel: 0.03 #the relative accumulated differences between two candidates
dmax: 0.07 #the maximum difference between two distances in two candidates 
dene: 0.02 ##the minimum energy difference between two candidates
