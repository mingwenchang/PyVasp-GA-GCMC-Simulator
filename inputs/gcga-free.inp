#Data setting
#NOTE:
#For a free cluster gcga mode:
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined box
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species with the following orders:
#clu-atom1, clu-atom2, gas-atom1, gas-atom2. (Always put POTCARs of clu atoms in the first!!)
inputs: # the '-' symbole is required. 
   - INCAR
   - KPOINTS 
   - POTCAR 
   - POSCAR 
#  - vdw_kernel.bindat #for vdw-DFT calculations

#environment setting:
vacuum: False #GA simulation in a mu-VT ensemble 
temperature: 300. #(K)
pressure: 1.00#(bar) 
gasphase: O  #only support linear/monatomic molecules  
#Chemical potential of O:
#mu = 0.5*[Etotal(O2) + Ezpe(O2) + mu(P, T)(O2)]
#from the NIST table (eV) or pyVASPtools (idealthermo.py)
chempot: 
    - O: -2.5745 #chemial potential of O (eV)
    - Au: -0.183494 #the energy per Au atom (eV)
    - Pd: -1.461596 #the energy per Pd atom (eV)

#This setting will generate and screen over 50*12 = 600 structures
gamode: free #free/supported
maxgacycle: 50 # maximum itetative cycle for GA 
genpopsize: 12 #the population size for GA per generation

#Cluster composition setting:
#formate (the order is matter!!):   
cluster: #same as your POTCAR!! 
    - Au: 6 
    - Pd: 2
#   - X: num
 
#HPC setting
hpc: cartesius #cartesius/tue/(a path to a yaml file) 
ncpus: 24 #the number of processors (cpus) per a job 
walltime: 4 #the time limit (hours) for a job 
refreshtime: 300 #refresh time (sec) for the info update of GA 
maxretry: 2  #max. attempts for an unconverged job

#Converge criterion setting
force: 0.10  #force unit in Angstrom/eV (same as the ediffg value in INCAR)

#The parameters to characterize two clusters whether identical:
#Usually, you don't neet to change them.
#cf. https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4886337
drel: 0.03 #the relative accumulated differences between two candidates
