#Data setting
#NOTE:
#For a free cluster ga mode:
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined box
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species in the cluster 

#For a supported cluster ga mode
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined BARE/CLEAN surface. 
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species with the following orders:
#slab-atom1, slab-atom2,..., clu-atom1, clu-atom2,... (Always put POTCARs of slab atoms in the first!!)

#For a free cluster gcga mode:
#POSCAR contains the information of a well-defined box
#POTCAR contains the pseudopotential for each atomic species with the following orders:
#clu-atom1, clu-atom2, gas-atom1, gas-atom2. (Always put POTCARs of clu atoms in the first!!)
